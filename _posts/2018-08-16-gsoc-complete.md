<p class="heading">The end of Google Summer of Code 2018 at coala</p>
<p class="content">
The final week of GSoC! coala pyflakes is ready with three bears PEP8NamingBear,
NoFutureImportBear and BuiltinsBear. These last three months were full of thrill,
excitement and much frustration as well. And this doesn’t end here,
I’d love to contribute in the future and be a mentor in GSOC 2019.
I believe people must try to contribute to open source organizations as it
helps you learn and gain much experience in a short period of time
especially when working for a great platform like Google Summer of Code.

<p class="heading">How was it</p>
<p class="content">
The day GSoC selection results were announced was on my birthday, and so
couldn't have asked for any better gift than this from coala and google.
The initial bonding period was really useful, during that period I dived into the
pyflakes repository to get some understanding on how it works. Then I started
working on my cEP(coala enhancement proposal), trust me making such reports
before starting to code is really helpful. Then during the first coding
phase my work revolved around creating and testing PyFlakesASTBear. After
one month I was able to make an initial version of this metabear however, it
wasn't much usable. The functionality got more enhanced when I started working
on plugins. The next two months then mostly revolved around plugin creation
and their documentation. I even worked on a few issues in pyflakes and coala
mobans repository.

I am really happy working with the awesome coala community and the people
here are fantastic. So, in the end, a big thanks to my mentor John Vanderberg,
without his help & support throughout the program, wouldn’t have been possible
for me to reach the end phase of GSoC. Thanks to the coala community members
for choosing me as a GSoC student and thus providing me such a great opportunity
and also for being very kind and helpful throughout the program.
And I want to thank Google for making this all possible.
Hope I get a chance to work with you all again!!
